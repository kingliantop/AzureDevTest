* Backlog

** TODO Break out each container into its own repo

In order to better implement CI we need to break out each container
into its own repo so that we can monitor and operate on them
individually.

** TODO Move all Docker commands to Docker Build Step plugin
*** DONE Install docker plugins
Installed:

docker-plugin:0.15.0
docker-build-step:1.32

*** TODO Configure the docker plugins so they work properly

Currently we don't use the Docker plugins for build/run/push steps.

*** TODO Create build steps for each container


*** TODO Can probably remove docker install steps from Dockerfile
** TODO Use Docker in Docker to allow CI to be on the same VM as the dev environment
** TODO Don't use host directory for data volume
** TODO Optimize build file to improve build times
*** TODO Consider moving the plugins download step to earlier in the build process
