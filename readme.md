This is a very simple demo application that is used to show a web
client applicatoin and a Java application executing in Docker
containers. We also include a simple load testing container. 

The application is very simple, a web client application communicates
with a Java REST API and returns the information to the user.

This is not a real application. It doesn't do anything useful and it
isn't intended to do so. Neither is it a demonstration of best
practice application management. It is merely an introduction to using
containerized applications on Microsoft Azure.

# Getting Started #

See the demo folder for some tutorials written in demo format.  If you
are new to Docker then you probably want to start there. If you are
new to Docker you will want to start with the 101 demo and work your
way up. Otherwise jump in at any point you feel comfortable.

Naturally tutorials and demo's can always be improved. Please raise 
issues and, preferably, issue pull requests.
